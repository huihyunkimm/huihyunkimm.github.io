Project: Circle of Emotions  
Author: s4032064 Huihyun Kim  


[Design Intention]

“Circle of Emotions” is an interactive digital prototype that visually explores 
emotional states through color and motion. Three circles are placed at the 
center of the screen, each representing PEACE, ANGER, and FEELING BLUE.  
When a user clicks a circle, the background and animation transition to express 
the selected mood, allowing the viewer to feel and interpret emotions through 
visual change.

Before interaction begins, hovering over each circle reveals a soft glowing 
outline in its respective emotional color. This subtle cue invites curiosity 
and encourages users to explore before committing to an emotion.

PEACE uses warm yellow tones and a gentle ripple animation to visualize calm 
and serenity. ANGER is expressed through deep wine-red gradients and a 
swirling, restless motion that conveys inner turbulence, while FEELING BLUE 
is represented by slow vertical movement and muted cool hues that evoke 
a sense of melancholy.


[Code Structure]

1. HTML — Defines the base structure including the title, three emotion circles, 
   and ambient background layers.

2. CSS — Controls color palettes, layout, animations, and transitions for each 
   emotional state (PEACE, ANGER, BLUE). The attribute `body[data-state]` is used 
   to dynamically switch visual themes.

3. JavaScript — Manages user interaction logic:
   - `setActive()`: Highlights the clicked circle and dims the others.  
   - `setTheme()`: Updates the body’s data attribute to trigger theme changes in CSS.  
   - `updateActiveCenter()`: Calculates the center coordinates of the selected circle 
      (used for ripple animation placement).  
   - `spawnRing()`: Creates and animates expanding ripple rings.  
   - `startPeaceLoop()` / `stopPeaceLoop()`: Controls continuous ripple generation 
      in PEACE mode only.  
   - `setMood()`: Handles the transition between emotional states and triggers related animations.  
   - Event Binding: Each `.dot` element listens for clicks to activate the mood transition.


[Benefits] 
 
1) Multisensory Expansion: Integrating sound or haptic feedback could deepen 
  the immersive quality of emotional expression.  

2) Scalability of Emotion: Additional emotion circles could be introduced, 
  allowing users’ selections to be recorded over time and visualized as an 
  “Emotional Map” — a timeline of shifting moods and emotional flow.

[Challenges]

1) Accessibility: Since emotions are expressed primarily through color and motion, 
  the experience may be less accessible to users with visual or perceptual limitations. 
   
2) Subjective Interpretation: Emotional visuals can be interpreted differently 
  depending on personal or cultural context, making it difficult to establish 
  a universally shared “visual language of emotion.”

  Ultimately, “Circle of Emotions” is an exploration of how subtle movements and 
color transitions can communicate emotion without relying on complex interfaces.  
It experiments with emotional expression through visual language — where the act 
of transition itself becomes the emotional experience.

[Reflection]  

During this project, I faced several challenges while translating my visual ideas 
from the wireframe stage into real interaction. In particular, it was difficult 
to make the *ANGER* motion feel as strong and expressive as I initially imagined.  
Expressing intense emotion through rhythm and motion turned out to be both 
technically and aesthetically demanding.

I initially aimed to create a visually striking prototype, 
but I realized how important it is to bridge the gap between ideation and implementation. 
Moving forward, I aim to consider not only the concept itself but also the structural 
and technical aspects of motion design.
